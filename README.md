# cancrizans canon

Long and long gone. I make comix and videogames and a bunch of other things

## webcomics

[Flesh Kernel](https://fleshkernel.com) - aliens, gods and madness in the 24th century.

[Lemma](https://cancrizans.github.io/lemma) - strange, strange science.

## videos games

Game-making-wise I am 100% of **bad_vertex**, and I've inflicted [Psilosybil](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1696720/PsiloSybil/) upon the face of the Earth.

## software

[gutta](https://github.com/cancrizans/gutta) is a minimalist, modular static site builder for webcomics.
